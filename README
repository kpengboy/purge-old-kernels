This script removes all but the last N kernels of each kernel series installed.
N is a number which defaults to 3. This script is suitable for both being
run as a cronjob and being run manually.

If you would like to use this script, keep in mind that it may not be polished
too well. In particular, it could be rather raw with error conditions and
error messages. Oh, and there's no warranty on this script either; you assume
the risks if you choose to run it.
